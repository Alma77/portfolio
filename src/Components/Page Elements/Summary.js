                Hello! My name is Tanner Trimble. I'm a Software Engineer with an interest in Web-Development.
                My expertise is in C# and Asp.Net for Back-End. For the Front-End side of things I use HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                I'm young and am eager to expand my skill set and learn new technologies so I can design and write 
                beautiful software.
